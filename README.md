React Slack Feedback
=====================

Meteor package for gathering user feedback to send to slack.

## Install

```
meteor add fgriberi:react-slack-feedback
```

To use the component, import it and render in your app's global component,
or individual components (if you don't want it on every page).

> NOTE
Your Slack Webhook URL should _never_ be available on the front end.
For this reason you must have a server which sends the request to slack.
This component will produce the JSON object to send to Slack but it won't send
the request for you.

## How to use

```js
import SlackFeedback from 'meteor/react-slack-feedback';

<SlackFeedback
  // required
  channel="#general"
  // NOTE: The `onSubmit` method is called with the SlackFeedback context which
  // allows you to call `this.sent()` in the sendToSlack function. If you use
  // `payload => sendToSlack(payload)` or `sendToSlack.bind(this)` then you must
  // use a ref to call the sent method. i.e `this.refs.SlackFeedback.sent();`
  onSubmit={sendToSlack}
  onImageUpload={uploadImage}
  disabled={true} // completely disable the component (default = false)
  user="Users Name" // The logged in user (default = "Unknown User")
  emoji=":bug:" // default = :speaking_head_in_silhouette:
/>

/**
 * Send the Slack message to your server
 * @param  {Object} payload
 * @return {null}
 */
function sendToSlack(payload) {
  $.post('/api/slack', {
    data: payload
  }).then(res => {

    // The `onSubmit` prop function is called with the SlackFeedback component
    // context (this.props.onSubmit.call(this, payload)), meaning the component
    // methods are available from this function. You should call the `sent`
    // method if the request was successfully sent to Slack.
    this.sent();
  }, error => {
    this.error(error.statusText);
  });
}

/**
 * Upload image to server
 * @method uploadImage
 * @param  {File} image
 * @return {null}
 */
function uploadImage(image) {
  var form = new FormData();
  form.append('image', image);

  $.post('/api/upload', { data: form })
    .then(
      // It is important that you call the `imageUploaded` method or
      // the component will load indefinitely.
      //
      // If you've called the `uploadImage` function with `image => uploadImage(image)`,
      // you'll have to use a ref on the SlackFeedback component to access the
      // 'imageUploaded' and 'error' methods
      url => this.imageUploaded(url),
      err => this.error(err)
    );
}

```

### Props
| Prop     | Type   | Default      | Required      | Description |
|----------|--------|--------------|:-------------:|-------------|
| channel       | string |   | required | The Slack channel to send messages. Note: All slack channels are lowercase. The string should be identical to the channel name e.g '#feedback' |
| onSubmit | function |    | required | A JSON payload object will be returned when the user submits the form. |
| onImageUpload | function |    |  | Method that will be called with a file argument |
| user          | string | "Unknown User" |               | The logged in user's name (if applicable) |
| emoji         | string | ðŸ—£ |          | The emoji that will show in place of the users avatar on Slack |
| buttonText    | string | "Slack Feedback" |          | The text for the trigger button |
| disabled    | boolean | false |          | Disable the component entirely. Returns null. Can be used to disable the component on specific pages |

### Callback Functions
| Function  | Arguments | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| sent()  |  | Should be called when the payload has been successfully sent to your sever. The submit button will display a `Sent!` message and reset the loading state. |
| error()  | error (string) | Should be called if there's an error sending the slack payload to your server. Pass the `statusText` of the response to update the submit button. |
| imageUploaded()  | url (string) | Should be called if an image is successfully uploaded to your server. This adds the image url to the payload JSON and resets the loading state of the component. |
| uploadError() | error (string) | Should be called if there's an error uploading an image. |
